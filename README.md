Hi all! My name is Yulia and few months ago I've started to learn Web UA. I really like it and hope to get enough knowledge and skills to get a job in this sfera very soon.
## Git Basics
The Git course on COURSERA is quite affordable and convenient.
At the same time, learning on learngitbranching.js.org is not very convenient, they need to use better UI/UX there)
## Linux CLI, and HTTP

It was the first experience of learning Linux. It was not so complicated but I don't understand the purpose of learning it if I don't plan to work with it.
## Git Collaboration

I had no experience of git collaboration before, so it's new and little bit complicated for me.
## Intro to HTML and CSS

Previously, I already had the experience of studying HTML & CSS, so it was simply to me.
## Responsive Web Design

Few months ago I've watched all videos on thise channel and have some practice in Web Design.
